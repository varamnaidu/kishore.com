He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.

Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the <q style="color:blue;">People's President</q>, he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the<b style="color:blue;"> Bharat Ratna,</b> India's highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands including national-level dignitaries attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where he was buried with full state honours.next tab <a href="Tendulkar.html" class="h2">Blog2</button></a><p></h4>
